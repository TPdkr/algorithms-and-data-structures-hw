# Algorithms and data structures assignments (Spring 2024)
Assignments for 2023 Fall Algorithms and data structures course grouped into a repo. I published it in
early 2026 in order to link with my website and provide the source. It was completed at 
Constructor University Bremen.

The course and assignments taught basic algorithms such as those on graps and binary trees.

## Languages
All the tasks are implemented in C++, while for viualizations I used Python and matplotlib.
- C++
- C
- Python
- Makefiles

## Directory structure
This repo is structured based on weeks of the course and each one has a Makefile in accordance with the requirements
set by the Professor. Also, there is a practice questions directory that helped me prepare for the exam.

(running ```tree -L 1``` in the main directory of the repo yields the result below)
